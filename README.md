**Stable intelligence requires more than recursion.**

This repository implements *Synthetic Self* mechanisms combined with
**Outcome-Centric Blame (OCB)** to stabilize long-horizon continuous learning.

> Recursion increases capability.  
> Stability enables intelligence.

## What’s inside
- Synthetic Self (identity continuity)
- Sequence Blame Tree (non-vanishing responsibility)
- Predictive Capacity Forecaster
- Surgical rollback (layer-level)
- Experiments: Humanoid-v4, BipedalWalker

## Status
Research prototype. Reproducible experiments and figures will be added incrementally.
