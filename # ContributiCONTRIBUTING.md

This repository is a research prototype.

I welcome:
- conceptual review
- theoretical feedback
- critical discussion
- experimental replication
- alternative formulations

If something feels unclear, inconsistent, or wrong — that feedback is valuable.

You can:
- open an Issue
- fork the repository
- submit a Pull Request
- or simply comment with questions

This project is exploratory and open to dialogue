# Contributing

This repository is a research prototype.

I welcome:
- conceptual review
- theoretical feedback
- critical discussion
- experimental replication
- alternative formulations

If something feels unclear, inconsistent, or wrong — that feedback is valuable.

You can:
- open an Issue
- fork the repository
- submit a Pull Request
- or simply comment with questions

This project is exploratory and open to dialogue.
